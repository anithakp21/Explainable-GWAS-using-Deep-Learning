 Master's Project: Explainable Genome Wide Association Study using Deep-Learning

A Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) is a research approach that involves scanning the entire human genome to identify genetic variations- Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a particular trait or disease. It explores the relationship between variations in the DNA sequence and the occurrence of specific traits or diseases across a large population. By analyzing the genomes of many individuals, researchers can identify genetic markers or variants linked to the trait under investigation. 
GWAS has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the genetic basis of various conditions, from common diseases to complex traits.

This project makes use of a deep Learning framework called GenNet to predict complex disease like class-3 obesity with the help of genetic data from the UKBIOBANK.

OUTCOMES:
1. Discovered 10 genetic variants underlying class-3 obesity through GenNet using the UKBIOBANK data and achieved an AUC of 70%.
2. Conducted a comparative analysis between GenNet and the statistical GWAS method using PLINK.
3. I also scored distinction in my final project submission for my project implememtation, thesis writing and and also in the viva.
